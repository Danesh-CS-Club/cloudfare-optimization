# Introduction to website optimization with NextJs

With 20% of the entire web being ran through cloudfare it is important to understand the fundementals of website optimizations and speed, so much so that 53% of visits are abandoned if a mobile site takes longer than 3 seconds to load. 

## Optimizations discussed

1. Cloudflare Workers. Implementing automatic compression aswell as custom edge caching logic. Used Brotli and Gzip for 70% compression.
2. Header configuration `_headers`. Implementing proper security headers aswell as CDN cache rules
3. Lazy Loading images.
4. DNS pre-fetch.
